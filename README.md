This seminar serves as a guide of the basics of experimental design and data analysis. It is structured to serve all types of linguists as we move 
from the analysis of categorical data on to models that support continuous data. By the end of the seminar, you will be able to design, implement, and analyze your own experiment within any linguistic paradigm.
