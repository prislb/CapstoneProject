<h1 align="center"> Google Data Analytics Capstone Project </h1>

## Applied Learning Project

Google's Data Analytics course was very helpful in that it simulated real-world scenarios that are critical for success in the workplace. The content was highly interactive with a mix of videos, assessments, and hands-on labs that introduced analysis tools and platforms, as well as key analytical skills required for data-related jobs, fon instance: data cleaning, problem solving, critical thinking, data ethics, and data visualization

The best part is that it gave me the opportunity to complete a case study with a real-world data set. This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook written in R with a detailed, step-by-step analysis of data from a smart-product.

In case you would like to see this notebook Directly in Kaggle, here is the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/priscilalpezbeltrn/bellabeat-case-study-june-2021/edit)

Enjoy!
